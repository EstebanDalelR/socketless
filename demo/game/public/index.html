    <h1>Super simple "socketless" mahjong</h1>
    <p>
      Mahjong is a four player "draw one, play one" game in which players attempt
      to turn a randomly assigned collection of tiles into a winning collection of
      tiles. Any player may claim another player's tile (even when it would not be
      the claiming player's turn; claiming makes them the active player) if that tile
      can be used to form a set of three of a kind, or four of a kind. In addition,
      suited number tiles may be claimed to form a set of three consecutive same
      suited numbers, but this claim may not be made out of turn order. A player
      wins once they have four sets and a pair. While pairs cannot be claimed during
      normal play, if a tile completes a pair and in so doing forms a winning
      four sets and a pair, that tile may be claimed <em>as a winning tile</em>
      (the claim can be made because it's a win, not because it's a pair).
