## Simple client/server

This is a very simple demo that shows off several clients connecting to the same server, waiting a few seconds, and then disconnecting again. Once the server has no connected clients anymore, it will shut itself down.

## Simple client/server with web interface

This is an equally simple demo that shows off a server with two web clients set up to play a game of tic-tac-toe.

- Open both web client URLs in a browser
- make one start a game, have the other join that game
- play some tic tac toe
- once both clients are disconnected, the server will shut down.
