# Documentation

There are a number of documents in this directory! And you probably know how to click links, so just head on over to...

- [the general architecture docs.](ARCHITECTURE.md), or...
- some ["How to" docs](HOWTO.md), or maybe...
- the [API docs](API.md), or if you're super into working on the underlying code, maybe even the...
- [Developer docs](DEV.md).

And can I just say, It's pretty awesome that you're actually going through the documentation! [Let me know](https://github.com/Pomax/socketless/issues) if there's anything you can't find!
